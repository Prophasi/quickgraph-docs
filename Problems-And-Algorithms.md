### Problems and Algorithms

It is useful to have in mind some ‘classic’ graphic theory problems. Those algorithms are often part of the base graph courses and it is likely that what you are trying to solve is in fact one of those problems. For each definition, we show how to solve this problem with QuickGraph.

The interested reader is encouraged to get back to his favorite graph theory book to get a more formal definition of each of those problems.
